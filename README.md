# WUT-Tools

This project is designed to make a series of tools that make getting imformation from *WUT(WHUT) Educational Administration System*(hereinafter called *The System*)  more convenient. Though Python will be easier to program for network programming, it used C++ as its main programming language.

This project uses a famous C network library named [libcurl](https://github.com/curl/curl), which is also widely used in PHP. This library has been statically compiled with VS2015, for the project is developed with VS. In other words, you can develop it yourself with VS2015.

These tools will include versions of CLI, GUI and even QQ(Based on the project [sjdy521/Mojo-Webqq](https://github.com/sjdy521/Mojo-Webqq)).

This is my first time to try making a *REAL* project, and I will update my progress in DEVELOPLOG and change logs in CHANGELOG.

(I provide an example user in *exampleUser.txt*. If you are not a student of WUT, you can try it.)

#v0.0.0 (CLI)

Enter the username and password of *the System*, and directly get the page of your timetable(Timetable.html).

The bug of this version:
Open the page with browser except Chrome will get a messy code, because the website developer didn't point out the label "meta charset".
Later will try to add the label manually.

#0.1.0 (CLI)

Now you can also get the page of your scoretable(Scoretable.html).

haven't fixed the bug.
